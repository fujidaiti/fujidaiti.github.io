After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!

## What I've accomplished

1. **Importing Components**: I learned how to import components from the `src/components/` folder.
2. **Using Components**: I then used the imported component in my `.astro` file.
3. **Adding Markdown**: I added some Markdown to my post to make it more readable.
